# Predicting-Car-Price-Using-K-nearest-Neighbors-Model
In this project, I will use the K-nearest neighbors model to predict a car's market price using its attributes. The data set I will be working with contains information on various cars. For each car I have information about the technical aspects of the vehicle such as the motor's displacement, the weight of the car, the miles per gallon, how fast the car accelerates, and more. The data set can be downloaded [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile)
